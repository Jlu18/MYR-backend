                    <p>Due to the nature of the Service, we offer its use to all persons, including children. Children are
                        able to login or register for a new account. Account registration via third party services is governed
                        under their own privacy policy. We do not require any information to use the Service. If a user is
                        under the age of 13, contact information for a parent or guardian will be collected. In the event
                        that you believe your child has created an account without your approval, please contact
                        <u>

                    <p>Due to the nature of the Service, your child will be generating content. The content created may be
                        shared with third parties or used for research purposes. We will make an effort to anonymize all
                        released data, but there are no guarantees to restrict the content created and shared by your child.</p>
                    <p>In the event the Service is being used in an educational setting, COPPA allows school administrators
                        to provide consent for the child. For information about a specific school’s policies, please contact
                        the school directly or visit the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) website at
